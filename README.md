# IOG-Service-Delivery-Incident-Triage


This service is broken down into nine distinct phases, Receiving, Validating, Logging, Screening, Prioritising, Assigning, Escalating, Resolving, and Closing

Receiving Incidents


The service desk haven an incident reported to them from a user and will receive notifiction via the following methods, telephone, email, web-based form or walk-up.

Validating Incidents


This part of the process receives details of the the problem being faced or the request being made and determines if this is in or out of scope if the IT Service Desk. Eg the problem relates to their company assigned computer is clearly in scope for support, but someone wanting to report a faulty light fitting in their office is contacting the wrong team and need signposting to the Facilties Team to report this issue.


Logging Incidents


Once we've validated a call as an incident the process moves to logging the call as an actual incident ticket. Locate the user's card and if no card can be found create the indcident ticket in your name, referencing the user in the descrition and brief description fields. Ensure the following information is captured, name, contact details, machine details (where applicable).

Check for an existing ticket or recent previous ticket reporting the same issue from the same user. I

Next, select the appropriate category & sub-category for the the incident. 

Add notes pertaining to the presented incident before troubleshooting to establish the present condition/situation. 

Screening Incidents


Once we have created the ticket the screening phase begins, this will take the form of questioning to establish the what's happening/changed, when did it change/did it ever work/did you everr have the access, are others affected the same way etc. We will also begin to determine if this is something a technican could resolve or will need escalating to another team.

Prioritising Incidents


Assessing impact and prioritising is critical to determining how much priority/urgency there is to the incident. If its a single person impacted or more. Can they work or does this prevent them undertaking their role? Are we able to determine a workaround. If others are affected, are they in the same location or is this affecting multiple locations. Seeting this information will assign the incident a priority.


Assigning Incidents


Typically the technician who has received the report will follow it through to resolution and the ticket is assigned to their own queue and set to work in progress status. The technican will work through troubleshooting using their tools and knowledge to resolve the incident. It might be necessary to assign the ticket to a colleague with more experience/expertise, in other cases they might need to escalate to a higher level/specialist team.


Escalating Incidents


If a technician cannot resolve a problem they escalate and this falls into two areas.

Exceeded knowledge or time to fix or the technican has no permissions to resolve the problem. In which case the ticket is escalated to the appropriate speialist team.

Resolving Incidents


Once the issue has been remediated completely the ticket is considered resolved. There are several options for resolving a ticket from the obvious 'Resolved' where your actions or provided information satisfies the problem. To ones where you have sign-posted to self-service to make a request to scenarios where we could not resolve, ie its a personal device we don't support. Its an application supported by a 3rd party not on our system so we cannot escalate, the incident is determined part of major incident or problem ticket so is a known issue and linked to a parent ticket and will be subject to a wider resolution. 

Technicians do not close incidents, they are closed automatically after 10 days but within this time window the user is able to update the ticket which re-opens the ticket and returns it to our queue.
